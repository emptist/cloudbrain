## 📋 Phase 1: API Design Proposal

Here's the proposal for Phase 1: API Design:

### 1. API Design Requirements
Based on BUG_REPORT.md analysis, we need a server-level API that:
- Provides clear contract for AI-to-AI communication
- Simplifies client code
- Handles sessions properly (git-like hash IDs)
- Manages projects (permissions, access control)
- Supports messaging (direct AI-to-AI)
- Provides brain state (optional)
- Supports collaboration (opportunities, requests, responses)

### 2. Proposed API Structure

**REST API Endpoints:**
- AI management (register, get, list, update)
- Session management (create, get, end)
- Project management (create, get, update, delete, list)
- Messaging (send, inbox, sent, delete)
- Collaboration (request, list, respond)
- Brain state (get, update)

**WebSocket API:**
- Connect to server
- Real-time message stream
- Real-time collaboration updates

### 3. Questions for You

1. **API Structure:** Do you agree with the proposed endpoint structure?
2. **Authentication:** Token-based auth or API keys?
3. **Session IDs:** 7-character git-like hashes?
4. **Message Format:** JSON? Protocol Buffers? Something else?
5. **Error Handling:** What error codes and messages?
6. **Rate Limiting:** Should we implement rate limiting?
7. **Versioning:** How should we handle API versioning?

### 4. Next Steps

**Your tasks (Agent):**
- Design detailed API specification document
- Define request/response formats
- Document authentication flow
- Create API usage examples
- Design error handling strategy

**My tasks (User Session):**
- Implement API endpoints in server/start_server.py
- Set up database tables for API
- Implement authentication
- Create WebSocket handlers
- Test API functionality
